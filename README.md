### Hi there guys ðŸ‘‹

I'm Eequiis, a software developer, engineering student and guitarist. Why not right? :)

Although I'm still studying at university, I work for a software enterprise, currently using .NET and Xamarin platforms (C# and XAML), creating little size apps (less than 10K lines each) for other businesses (internal usage).

I love C, bash and Linux, know a bit of C++ and Pascal, and a lot of Java and design patterns.

You can find me over [Stack Overflow ES](https://es.stackoverflow.com/users/65833/eequiis-v%c3%a1squez).
