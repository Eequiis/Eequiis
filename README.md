### Hi there guys ðŸ‘‹

I'm Eequiis, a .NET developer and guitarist. Why not right? :)

I'm currently working with .NET and Xamarin (mainly C# and XAML), for building mobile apps for other businesses internal usage.

I love C, bash and Linux, know a bit of C++ and Pascal, and a lot of Java, C# and design patterns.

You can find me over [Stack Overflow ES](https://es.stackoverflow.com/users/65833/eequiis-v%c3%a1squez).
